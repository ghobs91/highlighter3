    There are a few different ways of interacting with Zapworthy.

    <h4 class="text-4xl text-white font-serif font-thin mt-4">
        Browser Extension
    </h4>

    <p>
        You can install a browser extension to highlight and
        categorize the zapworthy content you randomly find.
    </p>

    <p>
        That extension even enables you to quickly ingest a
        worthy essay right as a Nostr long-form post.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-4xl text-white font-serif font-thin mt-4">
        @zapworthy bot
    </h4>

    <p>
        You can tag the @zapworthy bot with a URL you would like
        to be converted into a NIP-23 long-form post; so that you
        can use the embedded highlighter in this site. The bot
        will reply with a URL for you to use.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-4xl text-white font-serif font-thin mt-4">
        NIP-23 long-form content
    </h4>

    <p>
        Obviously, nostr tools prefer nostr content, yes, we
        are showing our bias here, but interoperable content
        is just better that way.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you find a NIP-23 content you can pop it right in
        using it's <code>naddr</code> and begin saving glorious treasures from it.
