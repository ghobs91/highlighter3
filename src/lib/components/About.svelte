    <p>Zapworthy is a feed of a new kind of Nostr event:</p>

    <p class="text-white font-semibold"><mark class="bg-orange-700 text-white rounded px-2 py-1">Highlights</mark></p>

    <p>
        Think of it as a way of keeping
        <span class="text-white">the words you find valuable running on Nostr</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This might seem trivial at first;
        <span class="text-white">what's cool about keeping this on Nostr?</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        It's just a synonym of unleashing the value behind those words by making
        them organically interoperable with the rest of the information you,
        and your network, have access to.

        I started working on Zapworthy basically immediately after reading
        <span class="text-orange-500">@dergigi</span>'s excellent
        <em><a href="#" class="text-orange-500">Purple Text. Orange Highlights</a></em>,
        and was fascinated by the idea of using Nostr to create a new
        method to improve the current tooling around reading and discovering
        new valuable content.
